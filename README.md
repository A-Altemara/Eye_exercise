## How to Run:

## RoadMap:
Change the eye movement so it can focus and come together when the mouse is in the center between the eyes
Reverse the movement so it is never looking at the mouse avoiding it as much as possible
Adding more eyes with different actions and buttons that flip the actions of the eyes to make it more interactive
Options to add eyes at User descetion
